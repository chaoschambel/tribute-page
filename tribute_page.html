        <h2 id="project">The Great Guitarist</h2>
        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p><strong>John Peter Petrucci</strong> (born July 12, 1967) is an American guitarist, composer and producer. He is best known as a founding member of the progressive metal band Dream Theater. He was voted <strong>"Best Prog guitarist"</strong>. His influences as a guitarist include Jimmy Page, Brian May, Eddie Van Halen, Steve Morse, Al Di Meola, Steve Howe, Allan Holdsworth, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Randy Rhoads, Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, Alex Lifeson, Yngwie Malmsteen and David Gilmour.</p>
        <h3>Guitar technique</h3>
        <p>Petrucci is respected for his variety of guitar styles and skills. One of the most notable of these is his high-speed alternate picking which, as he himself claims, requires a <strong>"strong sense of synchronization between the two [playing] hands."</strong> John is notable for frequent use of the seven-string electric guitar, which he says he uses as a writing tool, taking advantage of the extended range for heavier riffing and to play extended range runs as part of a solo. Moreover, Petrucci often combines his metal shredding technique with a slower, emotive soloing style.</p>
        <h3>Equipments</h3>
        <p>Petrucci is a long-time user of <strong>Music Man JP and Majesty</strong> series guitars and <strong>Mesa/Boogie amplifiers</strong>. While his pedalboard, controller, effects and overdrives have undergone changes over the years, the core of Petrucci's guitar sound remains Dimarzio pickups and Mesa/Boogie amplifiers. Most recently the signature JP-2C amplifier based on the Mark IIC+ series and other Mark and Rectifier series amplifiers, such as during the recording of Train of Thought.</p>
        <p>A number of brands have released signature guitar equipment designed or endorsed by Petrucci:</p>
